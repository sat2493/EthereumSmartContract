# EthereumSmartContract
Simple Contract involving Ethereum Blockchain

# Introduction

A [smart contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) is a computer program or a transaction protocol respectively, which is intended to automatically execute, control or document respectively legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract, of an agreement or of a negotiation. The objectives of smart contracts are the reduction of need in trusted intermediators, arbitrations and enforcement costs, fraud losses, as well as the reduction of malicious and accidental exceptions. The purpose of this project is to serve as an introduction to the basics of Ethereum that you will need to understand from a development standpoint, in order to produce contracts and decentralized applications. 

# Tools 

## Ethereum

Launched in 2015, [Ethereum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ethereum.asp) is an open-source, blockchain-based, decentralized software platform used for its own cryptocurrency, ether. It enables SmartContracts and Distributed Applications (ƒêApps) to be built and run without any downtime, fraud, control, or interference from a third party.

## Solidity

[Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.8/) is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.
